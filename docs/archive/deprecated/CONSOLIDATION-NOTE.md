## Consolidation Rationale

These files were archived as part of a documentation consolidation effort to:
1. Eliminate duplication between root-level and organized documentation
2. Create a single source of truth for each topic
3. Preserve the architecture transition from i386 to x86_64
4. Maintain all unique content while improving organization

## Access to Content

All unique and valuable content from these files has been preserved in the consolidated versions at:
- `/docs/01-GETTING-STARTED/QUICKSTART.md`
- `/docs/01-GETTING-STARTED/INSTALLATION.md`

The consolidated versions include:
- All unique features and commands from the originals
- Better organization and cross-references
- Clear notes about x86_64 vs i386 differences
- Comprehensive coverage of all installation methods

## Historical Reference

These archived files are kept for historical reference and to ensure no information was lost during consolidation. They represent the state of documentation before the November 2025 reorganization.
