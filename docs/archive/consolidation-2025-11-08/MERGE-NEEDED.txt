DOCUMENTATION CONSOLIDATION - MERGE REQUIRED
Generated: 2025-11-08
================================================================================

This file lists documentation that requires manual merging due to conflicts
with existing files in the target locations. Each conflict needs human review
to determine how to best combine the content.

================================================================================
FILES REQUIRING MANUAL MERGE
================================================================================

1. QUICKSTART GUIDES
-------------------
Source: ./QUICKSTART.md (326 lines)
Target: ./01-GETTING-STARTED/QUICKSTART.md (452 lines)

Analysis:
- Both files contain quickstart instructions
- Target file is newer and more comprehensive (126 more lines)
- Source file may contain unique content that should be preserved

Recommendation:
- Review both files for unique content
- Merge any unique content from source into target
- Consider whether some content belongs in archive/
- Delete source file after merge is complete


2. INSTALLATION GUIDES
----------------------
Source: ./INSTALLATION.md (845 lines)
Target: ./01-GETTING-STARTED/INSTALLATION.md (991 lines)

Analysis:
- Both files contain installation instructions
- Target file is newer and more comprehensive (146 more lines)
- Source file may contain unique troubleshooting steps or alternative methods

Recommendation:
- Compare installation methods and prerequisites
- Merge any unique troubleshooting sections
- Verify all installation paths are covered
- Delete source file after merge is complete


================================================================================
FILES KEPT IN ROOT (Special Purpose)
================================================================================

These files serve specific purposes and should remain in the root docs directory:

1. INDEX.md
-----------
Purpose: Main documentation index/landing page
Status: Keep in root as primary navigation document
Note: This serves as the main entry point for documentation


2. CONSOLIDATION-REPORT.md
--------------------------
Purpose: Documentation of the consolidation process
Status: Keep for reference during consolidation work
Action: Move to archive/ after consolidation is complete


3. DOCUMENTATION-CONSOLIDATION-REPORT.md

Action: Move to archive/ after consolidation is complete


4. DUPLICATION-HEATMAP.md
-------------------------
Purpose: Visual map of documentation duplication
Status: Keep for reference during consolidation work
Action: Move to archive/ after consolidation is complete


================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Manual Merge Required:
   - Compare QUICKSTART.md files and merge unique content
   - Compare INSTALLATION.md files and merge unique content
   - Delete source files after merging

2. Final Cleanup:
   - Move consolidation reports to archive/ when complete
   - Update INDEX.md to reflect new structure
   - Verify all cross-references are updated

3. Validation:
   - Check that no documentation was lost
   - Verify all links work correctly
   - Test that documentation flow makes sense
